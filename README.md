# Halo my name is Winona

I am a currently a student studying bachelors in Accounting. However I have no plans on working in the finance industry because I realised it wasn't my passion. At a 4 years old, I picked up a coloured pencil and started expressing my thoughts. I have been creating artworks since then and realised that is my happy place. Here is one of my recent paintings.

Years passed, I began to understand that creativity is not only about art. I can implement it in different situations or other subjects unrelated to art. 

There is no doubt that the world of technology have increased drastically. I found intrest in being part of this change. I became aware of coding because it has become a trend in social media. I looked into it and was mesmerized by the possibility of being able to build something from a series of letters and numbers. It is about creating which is the sole purpose of being creative. Hence I want to start a career in the tech industry.
